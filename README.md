## Description
        
Generates  professional READMEs using inquirer and fs. The user, after invoking the program using node, is prompted with questions that will ask the user what they want included in their README. 

## Installation 

You must have NPM and Node, and if you have those all you need to do is add the javascript file to your code. 

## Usage

Once you have NPM and Node, all you have to do is open the terminal in the javascript file (in this case, index.js), and you can invoke the program with "node (filename).js". Then, answer the questions, and a README will be generated! 

## License

## Contributing

## Tests

No instructions for testing! 

## Questions

I have no questions
